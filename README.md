# PyConsult by Swestastic

PyConsult is the logic and backend of my other project, PiConsult, now with a GUI for desktop use! I built this because I wanted to easily test new features for PiConsult, rather than having to deal with the Pi as a middle man.

This project uses PySerial for ECU connection, NumPy for arrays and data management, and Tkinter for the UI.

## Current Features

- Customizable settings

## Coming Soon

- ECU Connection
- Data Stream
- DTCs
- Test Mode

## Future Plans?

- Data logging and plots
